pre requisites
    residential slabs only for now


have a previous bill ready.
to check the app
    enter your last reading and date from the bill
    enter the start reading and date from bill
    red part of the meter isnt taken
        if reading is 204000, enter 204
    bill should match
        otherwise check units or send feedback via email
daily usage simulation is to see how you can affect your bill mid reading.
its not meant for a full cycle

bugs
    this is made for a one month billing period
        so make sure start and end dates are within this range
            otherwise, app will do what it can, but not perfect

todo
    host the website
    market or test out
    beautify the html and make more legible
    change email to something usable
    figure out gas consumption
        for a geyser turned on
        for a stove turned on
        what reduction can be expected
        what is most average usage of others around
            for number of people in household
            for number of geysers
    ways to reasonably reduce
        seal windows and doors
        switch to electric with timers/controllers
            stoves
            geysers
            heaters
            their cost comparisons
                cost to buy
                costs of install 
                costs of upkeep
        reduce usage
            temperature settings
                understanding how reduction helps
            timers
                like bluetooth timer device
                jal bujh
                electric breaker timers
        switch where and how geysers are connected to piping
            undersink
                connect to cold line so it doesnt suck from geyser
            outside bath
            insulate lines
                plastic pipes
                cover with foam
        maintain equipment
            geyser cleaning helps?
            anode rod
            any way to check if optimum
        wear socks/jackets
            personal heaters/heating pads/ usb power
        keep moving. what makes you feel cold is lack of blood circulation
    some sort of quiz to see what you should try first
        budget
        is timing consistent
        what is politically possible to change. home routines especially. anything to off peak
    when is gas cheaper than electric
        slab benefits
        off peak and peak
        solar
    add the hm3 vs slab chart somewhere for better visualization
    convincing others to reduce
        significant friction in changing mindset
        using when needed is responsibility 
            no compromises, just timing and waiting if timing is off
        for gas heaters, and stoves, indoor air quality is most pertinent
    maybe integrate bill upload, history etc later
